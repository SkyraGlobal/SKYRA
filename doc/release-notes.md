SKYRA Core version *v5.5.0* is now available from:  <https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra/issues>

Mandatory Update
==============

SKYRA Core v5.5.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will need to update their clients before enforcement of this update goes into effect.

Update enforcement is currently scheduled to go into effect at the following time:

```
Mainnet: block 3,715,200. ~Jan 20th 2023.
```
Masternodes will need to be restarted once both the masternode daemon and the controller wallet have been upgraded.
If you are running a Masternode over Tor, please read the "How To Upgrade" section.

Note: In preparation for the enforcement, upgraded peers will start rejecting non-upgraded peers few days before the enforcement block height, we recommend everyone to be updated at minimum a week before the final time.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra/issues>


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/SKYRA-Qt (on Mac) or skyrad/skyra-qt (on Linux).

Notable Changes
==============

New Rewards Structure
---------------------

Starting at block 3,715,200 The rewards structure is being adjusted after many months of discussion, analysis, and agreement from many in the community.

The new rewards are as follows:

|      Party     | Current Rewards | New Rewards |
| :---           |      :---:      |    :---:    |
| Staker         |        2        |      4      |
| Masternode     |        3        |      6      |
| Budget<sup>1</sup>        |        1        |      10     |

1: Budget coins are **ONLY** created if there is a valid passing budget proposal requesting a specific amount of coins to be created. This occurs roughly once every 30 days.

Network Activity Toggle
-----------------------

The GUI wallet now allows for the user to enable/disable all network activity from the Settings page. This can be handy if, for example, you need to restart your router or modem.

RPC Changes
-----------

### getblock additional verbosity

The `getblock` command now has an additional verbosity level. The command's second parameter has been changed from a boolean to and integer to support this.

- If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
- If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about block `hash`.
- If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about block `hash` and information about each transaction.

### getnewshieldaddress label support

The `getnewshieldaddress` command now supports an optional `label` parameter. If specified, the text label will be added to the wallet's address book.

### New setnetworkactive command

A new `setnetworkactive` command has been added to enable/disable all network activity. The command specs are as follows:

```
setnetworkactive true|false
Enable/Disable all p2p network activity.

Result:
status: (boolean) The final network activity status

Examples:
setnetworkactive true
setnetworkactive false
```

### New scantxoutset command

A new `scantxoutset` command has been added that allows for advanced searching of the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). As this is a highly advanced and complex command that won't apply to most end users, the full command spec won't be detailed here.

Please refer to the detailed spec by running `help scantxoutset` or refer to #2780.
